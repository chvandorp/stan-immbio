# Stan for Immunobiology and Infection

This repository contains an introduction to programming with Stan for immunobiology / viral dynamics / epidemiology modelers.

## Installing Stan

Detailed instructions on how to install Stan can be found on the [Stan website](www.mc-stan.org). Stan comes as a stand-alone application (cmdstan), but there are a number of interfaces that allows easy Stan access from your favourite scientific programming environment (R, Python, Julia, Matlab, etc.). In this workshop, we will mainly use Python (through the Jupyter notebook, see below) and the cmdstanpy package to interface with Stan. A similar package (cmdstanr) exists for R. Instructions on how to install cmdstanpy can be found [here](https://cmdstanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html).

## Installing Jupyter

Instructions on how to install the Jupyter notebook can be found [here](https://jupyter.org/install).
These instructions assume that you already have Python 3 installed on your system. If that is not the
case, the easiest way is to [install anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
